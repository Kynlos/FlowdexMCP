## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g flowdex-mcp
```

### 2. Configure Credentials

**Option A: Environment Variables**

```bash
# Windows
setx FTPMCP_HOST "ftp.example.com"
setx FTPMCP_USER "username"
setx FTPMCP_PASSWORD "password"
setx FTPMCP_PORT "21"              # Optional: defaults to 21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP

# Linux/Mac
export FTPMCP_HOST="ftp.example.com"
export FTPMCP_USER="username"
export FTPMCP_PASSWORD="password"
export FTPMCP_PORT="21"            # Optional
```

**Required Variables:**
- `FTPMCP_HOST` - FTP server hostname (e.g., `ftp.example.com` or `sftp://sftp.example.com`)
- `FTPMCP_USER` - Username for authentication
- `FTPMCP_PASSWORD` - Password for authentication

**Optional Variables:**
- `FTPMCP_PORT` - Custom port number (defaults: 21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP)

**Option B: Project Config File (Recommended)**

Create `.ftpconfig` in your project directory:

```json
{
  "production": {
    "host": "ftp.example.com",
    "user": "prod-user",
    "password": "your-password",
    "port": 21,
    "secure": false
  },
  "staging": {
    "host": "sftp://staging.example.com",
    "user": "staging-user",
    "password": "your-password",
    "port": 22
  },
  "default": {
    "host": "ftp.mysite.com",
    "user": "default-user",
    "password": "your-password"
  }
}
```

The server will check for `.ftpconfig` first, then fall back to environment variables.

### 3. Add to Amp Code

Open **Settings ‚Üí MCP Servers**, click **Add Server**:

- **Server Name:** `FTP` (or any name you prefer)
- **Command or URL:** `ftp-mcp-server`
- **Arguments:** (leave empty)
- **Environment Variables:** (leave empty if using system env vars)

Click **Update Server** and restart Amp.

## Development

Clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kynlos/FlowdexMCP.git
cd FlowdexMCP
npm install
npm install -g .
```

## Protocol Detection

FlowdexMCP automatically detects the protocol based on your hostname:
- `ftp.example.com` ‚Üí Uses FTP on port 21
- `sftp://example.com` ‚Üí Uses SFTP on port 22
- Custom ports can be specified via `FTPMCP_PORT` or in `.ftpconfig`

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.ftpconfig` files containing passwords to version control
- Use environment variables for CI/CD pipelines
- Consider using SSH keys with SFTP for enhanced security
- Set restrictive permissions (600/644) on sensitive files
- The `.ftpconfig` file is included in `.gitignore` by default
